Open-Disclosure
===============

The goal of the Open Disclosure project is to provide an easy to use web interface for Alabama's publicly available campaign finance data. This will empower citizens to better understand the flow of money in their
political system, and consequently allow them to hold their representatives more accountable. 

The project is modeled to expand on the [Open Oakland project](http://opendisclosure.io/) (Code found [here](https://github.com/openoakland/opendisclosure)). The Alabama version is intended to be immediately redeployable in other states. Additionally, it is designed with fuzzy campaign finance laws and practices in mind.
