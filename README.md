Open-Disclosure
===============

The goal of the Open Disclosure project is to provide a web interface that's easy
to use and understand with all the publicly available campaign finance data for
Alabama. This will empower citizens to better understand the flow of money in their
political system, and consequently to hold their representatives more accountable. 
It's loosely modeled after Open Oakland's project:
