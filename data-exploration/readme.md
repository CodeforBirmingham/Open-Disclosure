## Exploratory Data Analysis of Alabama Campaign Finance Data 
## Using R

### Motivation
While the primary aim of campaign finance disclosure is to reduce
the likelihood of corruption, simply disclosing campaign finance data
without analyses provides a shallow understanding of the flow of money
in our political system. Thus, these set of R scripts aim to provide 
a statistical foundation for analayzing Alabama campaign finance data.

We format our analyses in a question and answer format.
