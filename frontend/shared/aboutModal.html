                <br>
                <p>We aim to strengthen the community and government of Birmingham by volunteering to organize, develop, and deploy apps through open data and open source software. We strive to bridge the gap between the ever changing tech world and the government to make the lives of ordinary citizens like our selves easier. We know there is a lot of optimism, and a lot of eager hands willing to make meaningful changes in this city. We share this goal, and aim to focus all of that optimism and all of those hands towards perceivable goals. With open data, the sky is the limit. An inch of open data enables a mile of progress.</p>
